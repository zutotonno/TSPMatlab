Simulink Project: GAproject 
## Synopsis
That's a simple application of a genetic algorithm to the traveling salesman problem(TSP).
Imagine you're a salesman and you've been given a map like the one opposite. On it you see that the map contains a total of 20 locations and you're told it's your job to visit each of these locations to make a sell. 
Using brute force will require 20! tests so this is an exponential problem.
Although it may not be practical to find the best solution for a problem like ours, we do have algorithms as Nearest neighbour algorithm  or the Branch and Bound to have a suboptimal solution. 
In this project written in Matlab we use another tecnique that use genetic algorithm notions to find a suboptimal solution.
